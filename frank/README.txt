Frank is an open source Wordpress theme designed for speed
This theme has been the personal project of P.J. Onori with the gracious help of Jon Christopher. The theme was designed to provide a lightweight theme focused on the reading experience.

Frank is fast
Frank’s main focus is speed. Frank keeps it basic—no Javascript frameworks, no unnecessary images, just a simple, no-frills, screaming fast blog.

Frank is flexible
Frank has several different layouts to choose from for your home page. Most layouts let you specify the number of posts to show and from what categories. Templates can be stacked by any amount and order to give you the structure you need. Additionally, there are plenty of well-placed widgets that will give you that extra level of customization.

Frank is forward-thinking
Frank is built on HTML5 and CSS3. The theme strives for 100% valid HTML5 templates. One way Frank is so small is that it uses CSS3’s effects and transitions to avoid unneeded images and Javascript. One side effect of this approach is that Frank does not support Internet Explorer 6 and moderately supports Internet Explorer 7 & 8.

Frank fits on your phone
Frank uses a subset of Foundation to provide a responsive layout for desktops, tablets and phones. Add this to the theme’s small footprint and you have a mobile-optimized blog.

Frank is for you
This theme is 100% open source and developer friendly. 

Frank ain’t finished
There is always more to do, but I need help. This project relies on community support, so if you find this theme helpful, please contribute.
